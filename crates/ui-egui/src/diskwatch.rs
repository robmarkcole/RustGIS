//! Changed on disk (#1477): the desktop watches the files its layers and local tile archives read,
//! every few seconds and when the window regains focus, and offers Reload Data for a source that
//! changed. Only metadata is read (`rustgis_engine::observe`): scans on a thread of their own, a
//! reload, save or export's own look on the thread its read or write runs on. Reloading is
//! always the user's choice and always goes through `ui.reloadData` or `map.reloadTiles`.
//!
//! [`Monitor`] is the state machine, driven by observations and nothing else; [`Watch`] finds the
//! targets, runs the scans and shows what the monitor says. Monitor state is the app's alone: it
//! never dirties the project or adds an undo step.
