//! CityGML 1.0 and 2.0 (OGC 08-007r1 and 12-019), read as 2D like every city model: each city
//! object becomes a row of a layer per object type and geometry family, its surfaces and solids a
//! footprint with its heights in `z_min`, `z_max` and `height` (see [`crate::citymodel`]). Written
//! from the standards and their XML schemas.
//!
//! The objects are the features a city model's members (`cityObjectMember`) hold, and the features
//! nested in their properties that have a `gml:id` or a geometry (a `BuildingPart`, a `Room`), each
//! with its parent's id. Thematic surfaces (`WallSurface`, `GroundSurface`, …) and their openings
//! aren't objects: their faces are their object's, and a `GroundSurface`'s are the ground a
//! footprint can come from. A geometry's level of detail is the one its property names (`lod2Solid`
//! is 2); a geometry in another property (a group's, a relief's extent) has none. Coordinates are
//! converted from the system the `srsName`s name (on geometries and envelopes, often the only place
//! a file names it), by its horizontal part; the URN and URL forms of a geographic system are
//! latitude first, as GML 3 says. Names that disagree are refused, unless a system is given in
//! their place, which reads them all and says how many named another.
//!
//! Attributes: generic attributes (`gen:stringAttribute` and its kin) typed by their element, the
//! measures and counts the standard types so (`measuredHeight`, `storeysAboveGround`, …) and any
//! property with a unit (`uom`) in metres as numbers, a measure in another unit than the metre as
//! text with its unit, and every other simple property as text; a code's list (`codeSpace`) isn't
//! kept, and is said. A property given twice is a list, and a structured one (an external reference) its JSON.
//!
//! No tree of the whole model is built: one pass indexes the document (where each member lies, and
//! the systems its `srsName`s name), and each member is then parsed on its own and its tree dropped
//! once its rows are built, counted a member at a time and stopped between members when its run is
//! cancelled. The text and the rows are still the whole model's. The file is hostile: each member's
//! nesting and node count are bounded as every XML reader's are, no DTD is read, and the faces
//! merged are bounded.
//!
//! A geometry given by a link (`xlink:href`, `#` and a `gml:id`), as a solid's faces are to its
//! walls' and roof's polygons, is read where the link stands, after what its object writes out, and
//! links a ground surface makes first: a geometry the object holds already at that level of detail
//! isn't read again, but as the ground when a ground surface links to one read as another face, and
//! through links each one is read at most once per object and level, so a cycle of links ends. One
//! written in another member is found by the index, which notes where each element whose `gml:id`
//! a link names lies: it is copied, with the namespaces and dimension around it, into a
//! document parsed beside the member, and the links in it are followed in turn. What a member's
//! links read is bounded by the member's size, and what links copy and read from other members by
//! the file's. A geometry that can't be read is said once, whichever object or link reads it first.
//!
//! An implicit geometry (`ImplicitGeometry`) is its prototype (`relativeGMLGeometry`, written in
//! place or given by a link), placed by its matrix at its reference point (OGC 12-019 §8.3), in the
//! file's axis order: the prototype is read once, in its own system, and placed for each instance,
//! the points placed in all as many as the file could write out.
//!
//! A part, a group's member or a group's parent given by a link (`consistsOfBuildingPart`,
//! `groupMember`, a `CityObjectGroup`'s `parent`) makes the objects it names a child and its parent,
//! as if one were written in the other, once every member is read; the link is kept as an attribute
//! too.
//!
//! Not read, and said: geometries given by a link to another file or nothing, to what isn't a
//! geometry, or to one where this reader draws nothing (an appearance's, a terrain intersection's);
//! a prototype's geometry linked from outside its implicit geometry, and links inside a prototype;
//! thematic surfaces and openings given only by a link; rings, a line's or ring's points and curves,
//! and an oriented curve's base curve given by one; terrain intersection curves; an implicit
//! geometry whose prototype is in another file (`libraryObject`) or whose matrix isn't 16 numbers
//! with `0 0 0 1` last (drawn at its reference point); a group member's role; appearances,
//! addresses, TIN reliefs, and the properties of thematic surfaces and openings (a name, generic
//! attributes); curve arcs and splines are read as straight lines. CityGML 3.0 is refused.
