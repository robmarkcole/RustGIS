//! Writing a layer kept in the project back over the source it was read from (#1385), so that
//! the file shows its edits and keeps everything else it held.
//!
//! A Shapefile can't change one row in place: the whole file is written again. That is only
//! safe when nothing but the edits changes, so [`shapefile`] proves it before it touches the
//! file, and refuses, saying why, when it can't:
//!
//! 1. The file is as it was when the layer was read ([`FileSync::changed`]): a change made since
//!    would be overwritten. And it reads now as the layer was read: rows that weren't edited are
//!    written as the file holds them, not as an older read held them.
//! 2. The file as it was read, written again the same way, holds what the file holds: the same
//!    shapes (no Z or M values dropped, none left out), the same columns and the same values,
//!    compared as the bytes the `.dbf` holds, not as read (text a read trims, a code page's
//!    characters). Whatever a read and write of the file loses shows here, before the edits.
//! 3. The layer, written, reads back as the layer: every value and shape the edits made fits.
//!
//! A shape that wasn't edited is written with the coordinates the file holds, not converted to
//! longitude/latitude and back, so a projected file's shapes stay as they were to the bit.
//!
//! Only then are the new parts written beside the old ones, checked again against the bytes
//! meant, and renamed into place, the `.shp` last; any failure puts the old parts back
//! ([`crate::io::place_shapefile`]). The file keeps its code page, column widths, decimals,
//! `.prj` and `.cpg` where the edits allow; sidecars RustGIS doesn't write (`.shp.xml`) are left.
