//! Reads the desktop app makes on a thread of its own before a command adds what they read
//! (#1291 step 3): Add Data's whole-file reads (a raster, a raster GDAL converts, a GeoJSON,
//! delimited text or spreadsheet read whole, a CityJSON or CityGML model's layers), Repair/Reload Data, Load All
//! Features, Convert To Annotation's read of a layer read in place, native models or scripts, the
//! Error Inspector's topology check (#1291) and Source File State's hashing of a layer's file. [`read_ahead`]
//! takes what the read needs of the session, [`ReadAhead::run`] reads on the thread, and [`read_land`]
//! runs the admitted command under its initiating owner: the command takes
//! it instead of reading again, so what it adds, says, logs and puts in Undo is the same as when
//! it reads here. A script or the command line reads where the command runs.
