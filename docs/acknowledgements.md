# Acknowledgements

RustGIS stands on the work of many projects and their authors. Thank you to all of them. If your
work is missing here, please [open an issue](https://github.com/opengeos/RustGIS/issues).

!!! note "Disclaimer"

    RustGIS is primarily built with [Claude Opus 5.5](https://www.anthropic.com/claude), an AI
    model by Anthropic, working under human direction and review. Its results are tested, but check
    them for your own use, and please [report](https://github.com/opengeos/RustGIS/issues) anything
    that looks wrong.

## The GIS that came before

[QGIS](https://qgis.org) and [ArcGIS Pro](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-pro/overview)
set the expectations of a desktop GIS that RustGIS is measured against, and [GDAL](https://gdal.org)
those of reading geospatial formats. [MapLibre](https://maplibre.org) defines the style
specification RustGIS implements a subset of for vector tiles, and [PROJ](https://proj.org)
the coordinate operations it follows. [Zarr](https://zarr.dev) defines the chunked-array format
read by RustGIS's raster provider.

## Geoprocessing

The optional GeoLibre tool suite ([geolibre-rust](https://github.com/opengeos/geolibre-rust),
built on [whitebox-wasm](https://github.com/opengeos/whitebox-wasm)) brings more than 1,000 raster,
vector, LiDAR and hydrology tools, after John Lindsay's
[WhiteboxTools](https://www.whiteboxgeo.com).

The suite runs separately from RustGIS: through an optional downloaded `geolibre` program on
the desktop and command line, or a WebAssembly runner loaded on demand in the browser.

## Data

- [Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com) (public domain) for the sample data.
- The [EPSG Geodetic Parameter Dataset](https://epsg.org) of IOGP, PROJ's database and Esri's
  [projection-engine-db-doc](https://github.com/Esri/projection-engine-db-doc) for coordinate
  systems.
- [OpenFreeMap](https://openfreemap.org), whose free vector tiles and styles (such as Liberty)
  draw RustGIS's vector basemaps.
- [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) and its contributors,
  [Overture Maps](https://overturemaps.org) and [Protomaps](https://protomaps.com) for basemaps
  and open map data.
- The scientific colour ramps of matplotlib (Viridis and family, Cividis), Google (Turbo), Fabio
  Crameri's [Scientific colour maps](https://www.fabiocrameri.ch/colourmaps/) and
  [cmocean](https://matplotlib.org/cmocean/).
